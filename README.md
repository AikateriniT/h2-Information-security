A05:2021 – Security Misconfiguration

        - The article is focusing on the structural and architectural faults that lead to security risks, and makes clear the need 
        for threat modelling and more secure design. The insecure design is more common than we might believe it is, and every year 
        leads to massive data leaks and account compromisation. As a rule we can learn that an insecure design can not be fixed by a 
        secure implementation, as by definition it needs security controls that we never created. Factors such as insufficient business 
        risk profiling lead to the failure of a system that we are unable to determine the level of security needed.

        - By determining how exposed an account, an app, a website will be, we can assess the importance and the requirements of the 
        security system that will be implemented. Secure design by term is the methodology to constantly evaluate the threats and prevent 
        any known attack, but also to document all the vulnerabilities.
        
        - Prevention is the greatest work, hence our entire career will be successful if we are able to work proactively and not after 
        the "damage is done". By integrating a security language, by establishing and using secure libraries, by segregating tier layers
        on the system and the network and by threat modelling for critical processes we are able to keep our systems safe. 
        
A06:2021 – Vulnerable and Outdated Components

        Vulnerable components are a known great issue of our days that concern outdated systems which are unable to update, test and 
        assess the risk. 
        
        Vulnerability reasons:
        The OS is outdated and i missing critical patches, or it is unsupported. The clients or the servers are not scanned regularly 
        for threats. In general if we are not aware of the current threats, or if our practices do not align with the correct use of 
        the company that produces the componets, there is a great chance to be victimized. 
        
        Sensible practices will be to keep our components updated and obtain them only from the official sources over secure links. Also
        we must remove all the unused dependencies and unnecessary features. 
        
A03:2021 – Injection

        Vulnerabilities and data breaches happen when user-supplied data is not filtered, validated, or sanitized from the application. 
        Hostile data is used within object rational mapping, and is directly used or concatenated. 
        Parts of prevention include automated testing, using a safe API,

Darknet Diaries: Ep126 REvil.
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

I chose the episode with the REvil ransomware. The story begins with a wild scam story in the US, trying to show us how easy 
it is for a scam to emerge out of nowhere. It takes very little energy and a twisted mind, of course with the main goal being 
the money.
        
REvil ransomware emerged back in 2019, from another variant named GandCrab, and GandCrab is a group that cybersecurity specialists
call big game hunting. 
GandCrab is the name of a malware that encrypts the contents of the harddrive and posts a message asking for an amount of money in
order to provide the user with a password to decrypt the drive. GandCrab, was a ransomware that didn't target normal house users but
was targeting big companies with big revenue, resulting big money. GandCrab though still needed a way in for these big companies
        and the fact that there are people around the net willing to sell their credentials to give access to big companies that they used to 
        work with is unbelievable. 
        GandCrab eventually, evolved to ransomware as a service. You could buy the ransomware online in order to extort a company that you 
        know and have access to, and then get your share from the extorted money. In the darkm forums it seemed that the origin of the ransom-
        ware was russian. The US has no jurisdiction in Russia in order to chase or arrest cyber-criminals. And one day out of nowhere, it 
        disappeared mentioninh to their website that the company retires. But they came back bigger, with the ransomware maleware REvil.

REvil in the first phase was doing what all malware is doing, changing the wallpaper, delete the backups, etc. The bizzare to this 
        case was that the ransomware was making a language check and if the computer was located in a country of the ex-Soviet Union the 
        ransomware would simply exit. Ransomware REvil was in a way the best malware developed. The group decided after GandCrab that they 
        will no longer operate the attacks but they will sell it as a service. The customer would break into a company and then drop the REvil
        to infect the network. AFter that was the REvil group's job to do the rest.

A1 Injection (intro)                     

As an introduction to the subject we see that this lesson described what SQL is and how we can manipulate it in order to perform tasks 
that were not the original intent of the developer. 
After the task we will be able to demonstrate knowledge on:
        DML, DDL and DCL
        String SQL injection 
        Numeric SQL injection 
        Violation of the CIA triad.
What is SQL?

        It is a standardized programming language which is used for managing relational databases and performing various operations on the 
        data in them. As a database we name the collection of data which is organized into rows, columns, tables and it is indexed to make 
        it easier to find information. The three main protection goals in information security are confidentiality, integrity and availability, 
        are considered the three most crucial components of information security. 
        
On the the very first tasks we have to create an SQL query to manage to print the department of a specific employee. So it goes like:

        SELECT department FROM employees WHERE last_name='Franco';
        


Task is done. I will write the report soon :)

a) Sequel. Solve SQLZoo:
0 SELECT basics
2 SELECT from World, from first subtask to 5 "France, Germany, Italy"
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

0.basics is done with ease, and the learning outcome is:

WHERE: 

    SELECT population FROM world 
    WHERE name = 'Germany'

IN:

    SELECT name, population FROM world
    WHERE name IN ('Sweden', 'Norway', 'Denmark');
    
BETWEEN:

    SELECT name, area FROM world
    WHERE area BETWEEN 200000 AND 250000
